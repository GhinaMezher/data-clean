```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(here)
library(vroom)
here::i_am("data-clean.Rproj")
```

```{r message=FALSE}
life <- vroom(here("life expectancy raw.csv"))
```

```{r}
life|>distinct(IndicatorCode, Indicator)
```
Data set contains 2 subsets: life expectancy at birth and life expectancy at 60. 
We can therefore split the dataset in 2 subsets (very common).
Each Indictaor Code is associated with a specific Indicator.

```{r}
life_birth<-life|>filter(IndicatorCode == "WHOSIS_000001")
life_60<-life|>filter(IndicatorCode == "WHOSIS_000015")
```

They are not exactly the same size. 
We are able to use count as an alternative to distinct because count gives us n() and we can see that we have an additionnal value in "life expectancy at age 60". 
```{r}
life|>count(IndicatorCode, Indicator)
```
## Life expectancy at birth
Let's look at the country: 
```{r}
life_birth|> count(`Location type`)
```
```{r}
life_birth|> count(`ParentLocation`, `ParentLocationCode`)
```
We don't know the goal of this split between Locations. 
We want to map parent location code to parent location. 
In the final dataset we will only leave the parent location code. 
```{r}
parent_codes<-life_birth|>distinct(ParentLocationCode, ParentLocation)
```
So we get a new table that gives us the mapping. 
distinct helps us get rid of something redundant (normalizing). It is about splitting the data ito one dataset that removes the repetitions and one that has the repetitions.
We also do the same with redundancy (things that can be deducted from another variable )
With a join we are able to get back the true value from the code in our final data set.

```{r}
country_codes<-life_birth|>distinct(SpatialDimValueCode, Location)
```
We can now remove things that are useless from "life_birth". 
```{r}
life_birth<-life_birth|>
  select(-ParentLocation,-Location,-`Location type`,-Indicator, -IndicatorCode)
# for indicator abd indicator code they willbe deleted by a function we will develop later called single_value
```
We have to remove variable that always contains the same value as they are really useless. 
So we must find them and keep the values somewhere and remove them from our clean data base. 
```{r}
life_birth|>select(where(is.numeric))
life_birth|>select(where(is.logical))
```

is going to select the columns that are numeric and the one that are logical.
We want to remove the columns where everyone is NA.
```{r}
life_birth|>select(where(anyNA))
```
but this selects all columns that have at least one NA value. 
```{r}
life_birth|>select(!where(anyNA))
```
This selects the one that have no NA values. 

But we want to delete columns with only NA. 
```{r}
x<-life_birth|>pull(Dim2)
```
I want to count how many NA there are in DIM2. Pull takes from the dataset one single column/variable
```{r}
life_birth|>pull(Dim2)|>is.na()|>all()
```
all= TRUE if they are all NA, FALSE if there is at least one NA. Wee must therefore turn that into a function. 
we start attributing our column to a variable x (thanks to the function pull). 
So now: 
```{r}
all(is.na(x))
```
We must make this a function is order to apply it to all the columns of the data set. 
```{r}
all_na<- function(my_variable){
  my_variable|> is.na()|>all()
}
```
so we have defined our function. We have an object called all_na. We can apply this function to all variables. 

```{r}
all_na(x)
x|>all_na()     # a second way to write it with dplyr
```
So now we can rewrite our code by replacing it with the all_na function:
```{r}
life_birth|>pull(Dim2)|>all_na()
```
Our function expects a single object/input and gives us back one output.
We apply it to our select with a condition: it will apply the function to all variables and select the one where the answer to our function is TRUE.
```{r}
life_birth|>select(where(all_na))  #no () after all_na 
```
Applying the processing to many rows is what dplyr does. It is a column oriented framework. this is why select where and c_across are needed, to be able to work on multiple columns.

```{r}
life_birth|>select(where(\(my_var)all(is.na(my_var))))
```
We are directly specifiying we want a function with the "\" with the input being (my_var). It is an anonymous function. 
With a Lambda aka anonymous function aka closure.

so we are naming our anonymous function.
```{r}
all_na_lambda<-\(my_var)all(is.na(my_var))
```

So now we can remove all the variables with all NA.
```{r}
life_birth<-life_birth|>select(!where(all_na))
```

Now our goal is to write a function to say wether in a column the variables are unique. If they are all the same we remove the variable from our table. 

```{r}
life_birth|>pull(ValueType)|>unique()|>length()==1
```
```{r}
single_value<-function(my_var){
  (my_var|>unique()|>length())==1
}
life_birth|>pull(ValueType)|>single_value()
life_birth|>pull(SpatialDimValueCode)|>single_value()
```
Report the unique values :
```{r}
life_birth|>select(where(single_value))
```
```{r}
life_birth|>select(where(single_value))|>slice_head()
```
We remove them from the data frame.
```{r}
life_birth<-life_birth|>select(!where(single_value))
```

There are still many redundancies, and a long but thin data set.
we are going to take everything we have done and put it in a single function that we will call on life_birth and life_60.
